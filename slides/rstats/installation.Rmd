# How?  

1. Create a free [github.com](https://www.github.com) account. (Easiest)
2. Download Git (Harder)
3. Get Git, Github, and RStudio to talk to each other. (Hardest)

# Step 1: Get Github

Make an account tied to an email you'll have access to for a long time

Good practices for usernames: 

- Contains elements of your actual name (e.g. sctyner)
- Reuses your username from other contexts, e.g. email, Twitter (if appropriate) 
- You should be comfortable showing it to your mom or boss.
- Shorter is better than longer (less than 10 characters is good)
- Be as unique as possible
- Make it timeless. Donâ€™t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. SamTyowa

# Step 2: Get Git 

https://gitforwindows.org/ 

Install Git for Windows, also known as `msysgit` or "Git Bash", to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell.

- Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" during installation. 
- Install location should be below C:/Program Files
