# Defining Probability

## What is probability?

## Very formal definition 

> The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- What is a random process? 

## Very formal definition 

> The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- What is an outcome? \textcolor{red}{Any event or outcome of interest}
- What is a random process?  \textcolor{red}{Anything that causes events at random that can theoretically happen an infinite number of times}

## Examples 

Random Process | Outcome 
:-------------:|:-------:
Roll of a die | 6
Flip of a coin | Heads 

Others? 

## Some notation

$P(A)$ - often used to denote the probability of event $A$

Probability is always between 0 and 1. In symbols: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$

Probability can also be expressed as a percentage: $100 \times P(A) \%$

- e.g. $P(A) = 0.45$ is equivalent to $45\%$, $P(A) = 0.015$ is equivalent to $1.5\%$

Example: 

- Suppose we are rolling a fair 6-sided die. There are 6 outcomes, $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, and we are interested in the outcome $1$. 
- What is $P(1)$? 

## Law of Large Numbers (Activity)

>- Suppose we are rolling a fair 6-sided die. There are 6 outcomes, $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, and we are interested in the outcome $1$. 
>- We roll the die $n$ times. The symbol $\hat{p}_n$ represents the proportion of observed outcomes that are $1$ after the first $n$ rolls.
>- As the number of rolls ($n$) increases, $\hat{p}_n$ (observed probability) will get closer and closer to the theoretical probability $p$.
>- For this example, $p = \frac{1}{6}$
>- This is due to the **Law of Large Numbers**: the tendency of observed probabilities to approach theoretical probabilities as the number of total observations increases. 

## Disjoint outcomes 

- Two outcomes are **disjoint** (also called **mutually exclusive**) if they cannot both happen 
- Example: In a single roll of a die, the outcome $1$ and the outcome $2$ are disjoint, because they cannot both happen. 
- Example: In a single roll of a die, the outcome $1$ and the outcome "rolling an odd number" are NOT disjoint because if you roll a $1$, both outcomes have happened. 

## Probability of disjoint outcomes 

- Let $A$ and $B$ denote 2 disjoint events. Their probabilities are denoted $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ 
- We are interested in the probability of either $A$ or $B$ occurring: denoted $P(A \text{ or } B)$. 
- To compute this probability, we use the **addition rule of disjoint outcomes**
$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
- In words: if two outcomes are disjoint, the probability that one of the two will occur is the sum of their individual probabilities 
- Addition rule applies for more than 2 outcomes as well as long as ALL outcomes are **disjoint**.

What are some non-disjoint events? 

## Non-disjoint examples 

When drawing a card at random from a deck of cards: 

- Let $A$ represent the outcome that the card is a diamond
- Let $B$ represent the outcome that the card is a face card
- What is the probability of $A$ or $B$? 

Question: why aren't these events disjoint? 

## Non-disjoint examples 

When drawing a card at random from a deck of cards: 

- Let $A$ represent the outcome that the card is a diamond
- Let $B$ represent the outcome that the card is a face card
- What is the probability of $A$ or $B$? 

Question: why aren't these events disjoint? Because \color{red}{J$\diamondsuit$}, \color{red}{Q$\diamondsuit$}, \color{red}{K$\diamondsuit$} are outcomes that fall into $A$ and $B$. 

## Probabilities when events are not disjoint (ex.)

If we used the addition rule, the outcomes \textcolor{red}{J$\diamondsuit$}, \textcolor{red}{Q$\diamondsuit$}, \textcolor{red}{K$\diamondsuit$} would be counted twice: once for outcome $A$, and once for outcome $B$.

\begin{align*}
P(A \text{ or } B) & = P( \textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} \text{ or face card}) \\
  & = P(\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{face card}) - P(\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} \text{ AND face card}) \\
  & = \frac{13}{52} + \frac{12}{52} - \frac{3}{52} \\ 
  & = \frac{22}{52} = \frac{11}{26} \approx 0.4231 \equiv 42.31\%
\end{align*}
