## Very formal definition 

> The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- What is an outcome? 
- What is a random process?

> The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- What is an outcome? \textcolor{red}{Any event or outcome of interest}
- What is a random process?  \textcolor{red}{Anything that causes events at random that can theoretically happen an infinite number of times}

## Examples 

Random Process | Outcome 
:-------------:|:-------:
Roll of a die | 6
Flip of a coin | Heads
